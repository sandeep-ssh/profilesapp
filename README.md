# AWS Amplify Full‑Stack Web App (React + AppSync + Lambda + DynamoDB)

## Introduction
This project is a full‑stack web application built with **AWS Amplify**. It features a simple **React** frontend with **user authentication**, a **serverless function** to handle user sign‑ups, and an **Amazon DynamoDB** table for storing user emails. The application leverages AWS’s robust and scalable cloud services to deliver a seamless user experience, allowing users to sign up, log in, and store information securely.

## Why Use AWS Amplify for This Project?
**AWS Amplify** simplifies deploying full‑stack web applications by providing ready‑to‑use backend services, including hosting, authentication, API management, and data storage. By using Amplify, you can focus on building the application’s functionality rather than managing infrastructure.

## What I’ve Learned / Achieved
- **Host:** Build and deploy a React application on the AWS global content delivery network (CDN).

- **Authenticate:** Add authentication to the app to enable sign‑in and sign‑out functionality.

- **Database:** Integrate a real‑time API, database, and a serverless function.

- **Function:** Implement a Lambda function that triggers when a user signs up to the app.
